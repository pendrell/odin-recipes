    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Healthy black bean and avocado salsa wraps. These quick and flavorful black bean and avocado wraps are tasty, filling and make a great meatless lunch or dinner! They can also be made vegan too! </p>
    <p>You honestly can not go wrong with avocado wraps. I’ve made a few over the past few years and these black bean and avocado wraps are up there with the rest. The black beans are cooked with onion, bell pepper, garlic and taco seasoning for 5 minutes. To go with the black beans is a zesty avocado and tomato salsa that is prepared by simply combining chopped avocado, tomato, cilantro, and salt & pepper.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 avocados - peeled, pitted, and cubed </li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained </li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can corn, rinsed and drained </li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped </li>
        <li>½ red onion, minced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream, or to taste </li>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 cups of brown rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine avocados, tomatoes, black beans, corn, cilantro, red onion, oil, vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until salsa is well mixed.</li>
        <li>Spoon salsa into each tortilla and top with Monterey Jack cheese. Roll tortilla around filling to create a burrito.</li>
        <li>Warm burritos on a microwave-safe plate in the microwave until cheese is melted and salsa is warmed, about 45 seconds. Top burritos with sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
